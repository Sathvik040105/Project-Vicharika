## Double lambda issues
Nikshay: Only one point of contact. Instead, we will be trying the Grasshopper.
Two of the rear wheels are not connected to lambdas.
This provides protection against toppling. Stanford 2022 design copied.
The lengths are variable right now. Requirements:
- Climb rocks that are 1.5x the diameter of the wheels.
- 0.5 km radius in 15 to 20 minutes
- Ascend at 50 to 60 degrees.

## Realistic learning
Sahil: Focus more on the constraints that we have while working on your
subsystem, especially life sciences.
There are restrictions from URC and from our design.
Keep in mind the roughness of the terrain such as sudden potholes.
We need to transfer samples safely and need to focus on the safety of the rover.

Nikshay: We can't have rotating components such as fans and *centrifuges*.
Change in angular momentum is too hard to take into account.
Each bioanalysis needs time and we can't afford to stay still for that period.
We are required to bring back one sample, but we can bring back all (10g each).

## Collaboration
Naman: Everybody who has done anything so far, please update other people and help
them catch up. For example, create a YOURNAME.md in the relevant folder and
record:
- Papers, courses or books that you have learnt something useful from,
  with a summary of what you've learned.
- Papers, courses or books that you are currently working on. This is
  particularly important so that other people working on similar stuff know who
  to contact for help.
- Papers, courses or books that you plan to cover in the future, possibly with
  reasons for why you chose them.
Instead of or on top of this, you can update to the README.md when adding any
resource, covering stuff like what parts of it are relevant, do the details
matter or is an overview all that's needed, etc.

## Deadlines
- First protoptype: August 31
- Second prototype: Mid-November
- Third prototype: March
