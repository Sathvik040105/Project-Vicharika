We have decided to proceed with a "double-lambda rocker bogie mechanism" for
stabilisation of the rover.

"Design of Rocker Bogie Mechanism.pdf" covers a more traditional rocker bogie
mechanism. Double lambda is easy to understand if you go throught that.
The most relevant sections are:
- 1.1 Basic Description
- 1.3 Advantages
- 2.1 Study
- 3.2 Design of Components
- 3.2 Assembly of Components (the numbering is messed up)

For a look at the double lambda innovation, watch
