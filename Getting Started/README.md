# Getting Started

This directory contains generic information about URC and rovers.

The files are to be read in the order:
- Requirements and Guidelines 2023.pdf
- Design of a Mars rover mobility system.pdf
- Autonomous Task.pdf

## Requirements and Guidelines 2023.pdf
Read the entire document.

It mentions an optional drone, we will not be making one.
One salient point is that the rover can be modular, with parts that can be
swapped out between events.

## Design of a Mars rover mobility system.pdf
Also available online at 
[ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/258659740_Design_of_a_Mars_Rover_Mobility_System)
This can be read in multiple stages.
Equations can be skipped. Details can be skipped. Come back to them later.
The importance of this document is to get a feel for the design process.
Per the report itself, it "aims to be a guide for a future research work."

## Autonomous Task.pdf
Skim through this document mostly for knowing the useful terms.
